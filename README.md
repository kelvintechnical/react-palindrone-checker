# React Palindrome Checker

This is a simple React project designed to help users understand and check for palindromes (strings that read the same forward and backward). It integrates fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms with practical React development skills.

## Purpose

The **React Palindrome Checker** serves as an educational tool for:
- Practicing **string manipulation** in the context of data structures and algorithms.
- Applying **React concepts** such as components, state management, and user input handling.
- Developing a deeper understanding of **palindrome algorithms**, normalization of input, and efficient string operations.

## Features

- **User Input**: Users can type any string into an input field.
- **Real-Time Validation**: On form submission, the app determines if the entered string is a palindrome.
- **Normalization**: The palindrome checker ignores spaces, punctuation, and case differences to provide accurate results.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the concept of palindromes in **data structures and algorithms**.
2. Learn **React hooks** like `useState` for managing component state.
3. Practice building interactive user interfaces with **React**.
4. Develop problem-solving skills by combining React with algorithmic logic.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kelvintechnical/react-palindrone-checker.git
